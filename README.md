## Introduction
This project focuses on building an automated response generation system for customer support using the facebook/bart model. It includes exploring and preprocessing the dataset, training and fine-tuning the model, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, a demo interface is created to test the model with user inputs and sample queries.


## Setup and Environment
Ensure you have the following packages installed:
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `torch`
- `ipywidgets`
- `pandas`

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch ipywidgets pandas
```

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
### Load Dataset: 
The dataset is available on Hugging Face: Customer-Support-Responses.

### Data Preprocessing: 
Clean and prepare the dataset for training by handling missing values and tokenizing the text data.
```bash
import pandas as pd

train_data = dataset['train']
df = pd.DataFrame(train_data)
df.dropna(inplace=True)

def preprocess_function(examples):
    inputs = examples['query']
    targets = examples['response']
    model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=1024, truncation=True)
    labels = tokenizer(targets, max_length=1024, truncation=True)
    model_inputs['labels'] = labels['input_ids']
    return model_inputs

tokenized_data = df.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

```

## Model Training
### Load Tokenizer and Model: 
Initialize the BartTokenizer and BartForConditionalGeneration from the Hugging Face library.
```bash
from transformers import BartTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration, Trainer, TrainingArguments
tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-base')
model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-base')
```

### Define Training Arguments: 
Set up the training parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and logging directory.
```bash
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir='./logs',
)

```

### Initialize Trainer and Train: 
Use the Trainer class from Hugging Face to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
```bash
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_data['train'],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_data['validation']
)

trainer.train()
```

## Fine-tuning and Evaluation
Fine-tune the model for coherence and relevance using validation data and evaluate the model's performance on various metrics.

## Creating a Demo Interface
### Setup Widgets: 
Use ipywidgets to create text areas and buttons for user input and displaying generated responses.

### Generate Responses: 
Implement a function to generate responses using the trained model and display them in the interface.

## Saving and Versioning
Save the Model Locally: Save the trained model and tokenizer using the save_pretrained method.
```bash
model.save_pretrained('./finetuned_bart')
tokenizer.save_pretrained('./finetuned_bart')
```

## Testing the Model
Create a demo notebook (demo_notebook.ipynb) with the interface and sample queries to test the model interactively. Use the ipywidgets library to create a user-friendly interface.

## Conclusion
This documentation outlines the steps to build, fine-tune, and deploy a customer support response generation model using facebook/bart. The model is tested via a Jupyter notebook interface, providing an interactive environment for evaluating generated responses. The project is saved locally and versioned using GitHub for future reference and development.
