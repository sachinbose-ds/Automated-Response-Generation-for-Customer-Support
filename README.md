## Introduction
This project aims to build an automated response generation system for customer support using the `facebook/bart` model. The steps include exploring and preprocessing the dataset, training and fine-tuning the model, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, a demo interface is created to test the model with user inputs and sample queries.

## Setup and Environment
Ensure you have the following packages installed:
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `torch`
- `ipywidgets`
- `pandas`

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch ipywidgets pandas
